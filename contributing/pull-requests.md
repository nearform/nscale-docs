# Contributing - Submitting Pull Requests

This is a general guideline for submitting pull requests to nscale related repos.

## General

We try to review all pull requests, no matter how big or small as objectively as possible.

Some general tips __for non-nearform__ members:

- You will need to clone the repo.
- Although it's nicer to see feature branches being used, we have no problem with merging the master branch of your fork.

Some general tips __for nearform__ members:

- If you have push access to the repo, push your commits to a feature branch and create a pull request.
- If you want, you can push to your own fork and create a pull request instead.
- If you don't have push access, consider asking!

## Title & Description

The title of your pull request should very briefly explain what it does.

If your pull request is fairly small and self explanatory, a description is probably not needed.

If you've made some extensive changes, or if you're a ninja and your code contains black magic trickery, please consider including a description to make our lives easier.
